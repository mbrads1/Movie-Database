Final Project for CIS 452

CIS-452 Project

Project Description

The goal of the project is to implement a database application. This includes several steps:

        Finding an application for which a database would be required.
        Modeling the domain of the application using E/R or UML.
        Defining the application's functional requirements.
        Designing the database schema.
        Populating the database.
        Writing the code to implement the application.

Project Requirements

        Projects should be done in teams of 2 or 3 students.
        Projects must use a relational database with at least five (5) relations.
        The application must use SQL statements to access the database, and must demonstrate the use of joins (i.e. queries involving more than one table).
        The application should provide the user with a graphical user interface, and should not require the user to know anything about databases or SQL.
        Applications should not be tied to any particular hardware platform or operating system, i.e. they should "run everywhere". This means they can be web-based or written in Java. If you want to use a different run everywhere solution, check with me first.
        The use of code generation tools is discouraged and credit for code (java, html, etc.) produced with such tools will receive only minimal credit.

Completed Projects

The completed project must include:

        Description of the application and its architecture.
        UML or E/R model of the application domain.
        The use case model (diagrams and detailed descriptions).
        The database schema.
        A user manual or instructions (if needed for installation or use).
        Source code.
        Executables.

Projects materials should be submitted online in MyCourses.
Grading Criteria

        Correctness. Does the system behave "as advertised"? Are there any documented, or worse, undocumented bugs?
        Functionality/Utility. How useful is the system? Does it provide a real benefit to users?
        Robustness. Does the system behave gracefully under "unusual" circumstances? For example, if the database is unreachable, are appropriate error messages displayed?
        Design. Are the data and use case models accurate and consistent? Is the architecture appropriate for the application?
        Documentation. How easily can users learn to use the software? Can developers easily understand the design and implementation?


Topic Suggestions

The following are only ideas for topic areas, to get your thinking started. If you use one of these ideas, you will still need to refine the topic and decide on the exact functionality.
Movies

In this domain you might model entities such as movies, actors, directors, genres, playing times, reviews, etc. There are several sources of data available on the web that could be used to populate such a database. You could supply functionality such as finding specific playing times and theaters in a specified area by title, by director, or by genre. You could support updates to the reviews section of the database (allowing users to express their own opinions). You could provide personality profiles of people (e.g. the movies they like) and then recommend movies based on reviews by users with similar profiles.
Books

Functionality similar to the suggestions for the movies domain could also be implemented in the books domain. You could also support buying and selling of used books and textbooks used in specific university courses.
Apartments

The entities in this domain include apartments and their properties. Data might include number and kinds of rooms, rental price, bus lines, crime rate, distance from various landmarks, etc. The application could provide an interface for offering apartments for rent and for finding apartments.
Other

There is an endless list of other interesting domains including: hotels banks, airlines, used cars, sports, and so on.
